# Flutter Learning 60 Days Without Missing a Single Day

This repository documents my continuous Flutter learning journey for 60 days without skipping a single day.  
Each day will include new code, notes, and progress updates.  
**No AI tools will be used during this learning process - only official Flutter documentation, articles and other authentic learning resources.   

## Folder Structure 
The repository will contain separate folders for each day's learning progress - from Day 1 to Day 60 (or beyond).   
Each folder will include a `README.md` summarizing the topics covered, code samples, and reflections. 
- 📁 Day 1 
- 📁 Day 2
- 📁 Day 3
- ....
- 📁 Day 60

## Goals 
- Build consistent Flutter coding habbits. 
- Learn Flutter fundamentals, UI, state management, and APIs. 
- Create small projects or UI challenges as progress markers.
- Document daily learning clearly and honestly

## Rules/ Learning Principles
- Minimum 1 meaningful commit everyday
- No AI-generated codes or answer
- Reference Flutter documentation and other articles
- Focus on understanding not speed.
